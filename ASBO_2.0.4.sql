-- CTE 'e' - AUTOSHIP DEMAND & BACKORDER ANALYSIS (ENHANCED WITH COLT PROJECTION LOGIC)
-- ============================================================================
-- ENHANCED VERSION: Combines ASBO_Colt's forward-looking subscription projection
-- with historical backorder metrics for comprehensive autoship analysis
--
-- KEY IMPROVEMENTS FROM ASBO_COLT:
-- 1. TRUE Forward-Looking AS Demand: Projects actual subscription events 30 days forward
-- 2. Pull-Forward Day Integration: Accounts for operational AS fulfillment timing
-- 3. Success Rate Adjustments: Applies realistic decay factors (0.87â†’0.60) by days out
-- 4. Subscription Extrapolation: Extends recurring subscriptions across 30-day window
--
-- RETAINED FROM ORIGINAL:
-- - Historical backorder metrics (BO_Units_7d, BO_Units_30d, Weeks_with_ASBO)
-- - Product filtering and company-specific logic
-- ============================================================================
