# Self-Evaluation (C06 – Program Management)

## Context and Role Integration

Over the past year, I focused on stabilizing, scaling, and advancing CPFR capabilities during a period of significant organizational and technical change. Throughout multiple leadership transitions, my priority was to maintain continuity of service, deliver durable outcomes, and build foundations that improve the capability, resilience, and scale of in-stock decision-making over time.

## Scope of Impact

My work this year had direct impact on CPFR operations supporting Tier 1 vendors that represent the majority of Chewy revenue. Since May, I have owned weekly outbound CPFR reporting, improving reliability enough to move delivery from Wednesdays to Mondays and reclaiming meaningful planning time for ISMs across each work week.

In parallel, I supported significant expansion and normalization of the CPFR vendor ecosystem, onboarding 1,172 vendors (approximately 650 direct ship), consolidating three vendor management systems into one—eliminating key gaps between CPFR and VC/Chargeback—and fulfilling 417 CPFR maintenance requests and 181 VPP tickets. These efforts enabled CPFR to scale without degradation in service quality while strengthening cross-functional consistency and alignment.

A central area of impact was the creation and championing of **CPFR Infrastructure 2.0**, a Supply Chain–owned semantic data platform designed to serve as a durable single source of truth for CPFR and in-stock decision-making. This initiative required sustained cross-functional alignment, feasibility testing, documentation, and planning, and represents one of the most visible and anticipated evolutions of CPFR capability. It also opened opportunities to more tightly integrate vendor participation through CPH and VC, supporting more holistic and consistent vendor experiences.

I also developed a quantified entitlement framework identifying approximately **$1.4M in annual opportunity**, supporting informed prioritization and investment decisions tied to automation and self-service within CPFR’s scope.

## Consistency

Throughout the year, I consistently delivered results despite material disruption, including enterprise system migration, all-hands triage incidents, and multiple manager transitions. During the Vertica-to-Snowflake migration, post-cutover data degradation required two rounds of remediation; I personally revised and validated over 2,100 lines of production query logic in partnership with BI Engineering and senior ISMs while maintaining weekly reporting commitments.

Across this period, CPFR service to vendors remained continuous, with no service stoppages and only limited, communicated delays. This consistency helped preserve vendor trust and operational stability during a high-risk period.

## Behavior Alignment

I approached this work with a strong sense of ownership, bias for action, and emphasis on earning trust across teams. My role frequently required operating as connective tissue across Supply Chain, Analytics, Replen Tech, Product, and Vendor Compliance, translating complex requirements into workable solutions and aligning stakeholders toward shared outcomes with an emphasis on ownership, bias for action, and earning trust.

I was deliberate about strengthening CPFR’s identity and operating clarity by establishing a central knowledge presence, reinforcing single-source-of-truth principles, and clarifying ownership models. These efforts reduced ambiguity and made CPFR easier to engage with across the organization.

## Growth & Development

I made intentional progress this year in strengthening communication structure and executive-level clarity, particularly in situations where decisiveness and alignment were critical. I sought and applied feedback to make updates more concise and outcome-oriented and have received positive feedback on this improvement.

I have also been mindful of balancing foundational systems work with more explicit attention to ways of working and stakeholder pain points. As CPFR infrastructure stabilized, I shifted toward experience-driven initiatives that pair technical durability with human-centered effectiveness.

Looking ahead, my focus remains on maturing CPFR into a scalable, resilient capability while continuing to apply and expand program- and systems-level strengths where they create the greatest long-term leverage for Chewy.
